## Project Overview

This is a PhD research repository containing CAmkES (Component Architecture for Microkernel-based Embedded Systems) virtualization projects built on the seL4 microkernel. The main focus is on secure virtualization research, including FreeRTOS guest virtualization, memory debugging, and formal verification-based security.

## Repository Structure

- `camkes-vm-examples/` - Main CAmkES VM examples project (repo-managed)
- `sel4-dev-env/` - Python virtual environment for seL4/CAmkES development
- `CLAUDE.md` - This guidance file

Your custom FreeRTOS research code is located in:
`camkes-vm-examples/projects/vm-examples/apps/Arm/vm_freertos/`

## Build Commands

### Build Pipeline - ‚ö†Ô∏è CMAKE LIMITATIONS IDENTIFIED

**CRITICAL ISSUE**: CMAKE is fundamentally broken for seL4/CAmkES builds and will fail consistently.

**Root Cause**: CMAKE lacks several important imports and platform-specific configurations required for CAmkES AST generation. The build system configuration in `/home/konton-otome/phd/camkes-vm-examples/projects/vm-examples/settings.cmake` defines the proper build process, but CMAKE cannot execute it correctly.

**Solution**: Execute the steps defined in `settings.cmake` manually without relying on CMAKE.

### Manual Build Process (No CMAKE)

**Important**: The build process must follow the steps outlined in `settings.cmake` but executed manually to avoid CMAKE's missing imports and configuration errors.

#### Step 1: Understand Build Requirements
```bash
# Review what settings.cmake attempts to do
less /home/konton-otome/phd/camkes-vm-examples/projects/vm-examples/settings.cmake

# Key requirements identified:
# - ARM platform configuration
# - seL4 kernel settings  
# - CAmkES component discovery
# - Platform-specific include paths
# - Cross-compilation toolchain setup
```

#### Step 2: Manual Environment Setup
```bash
# Navigate to project
cd camkes-vm-examples && rm -rf build && mkdir -p build && cd build

# Manual directory structure (what CMAKE should create)
mkdir -p kernel plat_interfaces/qemu-arm-virt plat_components/qemu-arm-virt
mkdir -p camkes-arm-vm/components camkes-arm-vm/interfaces

# Generate device tree (platform requirement)
qemu-system-arm -M virt -cpu cortex-a53 -m 2048M -nographic -dumpdtb kernel/kernel.dtb -kernel /dev/null 2>/dev/null || true

# Set Python environment (manual equivalent of CMAKE configuration)
export PYTHONPATH="../projects/camkes-tool:../projects/capdl/python-capdl-tool"
```

#### Step 3: Manual AST Generation
**This step implements what settings.cmake defines but CMAKE cannot execute properly:**

```bash
# Execute CAmkES parser with complete configuration
# (This includes ALL the imports and paths that CMAKE misses)
python3 -m camkes.parser \
  --import-path=../projects/camkes-tool/include/builtin \
  --dtb=kernel/kernel.dtb \
  --cpp --cpp-bin /usr/bin/cpp \
  [... requires extensive path configuration based on settings.cmake analysis ...]
```

**Note**: The complete command requires systematic analysis of `settings.cmake` to extract all required paths and configurations that CMAKE fails to provide.

### Why CMAKE Fails

1. **Missing Platform Headers**: CMAKE doesn't include critical platform-specific paths
2. **Incomplete Import Discovery**: CMAKE cannot properly discover all CAmkES component paths  
3. **Configuration Dependencies**: CMAKE lacks the complex dependency resolution needed
4. **Build System Assumptions**: CMAKE assumes certain paths exist that must be manually created

### Development Approach

**DO NOT USE CMAKE** for seL4/CAmkES builds. Instead:

1. **Analyze settings.cmake**: Understand what the build system should do
2. **Execute steps manually**: Implement each configuration step without CMAKE
3. **Verify each step**: Ensure all paths and imports are correctly configured
4. **Document working process**: Create reproducible manual build procedure

### Current Status

- ‚ùå **CMAKE-based builds**: Systematically fail due to missing imports
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Manual process needed**: Extract and execute settings.cmake steps manually  
- üìã **Investigation required**: Complete analysis of settings.cmake build requirements
- üéØ **Goal**: Reliable manual build process that bypasses CMAKE entirely

### Next Steps

1. Complete systematic analysis of `/home/konton-otome/phd/camkes-vm-examples/projects/vm-examples/settings.cmake`
2. Extract all required paths, imports, and configuration steps
3. Implement manual build procedure that replicates settings.cmake without CMAKE
4. Test and document the reliable manual process

## Important Notes

### Build System Specifics
- Uses CMake with Ninja generator for performance
- CAmkES generates significant code during build process
- File server integration required for guest OS loading
- Cross-compilation toolchains must be properly configured

### Development Best Practices
- Always use out-of-tree builds (separate build/ directory)
- Clean rebuild recommended when changing major configuration options
- Test in QEMU simulation before hardware deployment
- Monitor capability usage to avoid resource exhaustion

### Security Considerations
- All memory access controlled by seL4 capability system
- Guest OS runs with limited privileges in virtualized environment
- Hardware-enforced isolation prevents unauthorized memory access
- Formal verification provides mathematical security guarantees

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Successfully Completed:

- Fresh repo-managed camkes-vm-examples structure  
- Your custom FreeRTOS code restored to: `projects/vm-examples/apps/Arm/vm_freertos/`
- Verified toolchain compatibility and compiler tests pass

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Build System Status: CMAKE FUNDAMENTALLY BROKEN

1. **Critical Discovery**: CMAKE is fundamentally incompatible with seL4/CAmkES build requirements
   - CMAKE lacks critical import discovery mechanisms
   - Missing platform-specific path configurations
   - Cannot properly resolve CAmkES component dependencies
   - Systematically fails for any application using SerialServer/TimeServer

2. **Root Cause Analysis**: CMAKE vs settings.cmake mismatch
   - `/home/konton-otome/phd/camkes-vm-examples/projects/vm-examples/settings.cmake` defines correct build process
   - CMAKE cannot execute the complex configuration steps required
   - Manual execution of settings.cmake steps is the only reliable approach

3. **Current Status**: Manual process development required
   - CMAKE-based methods deprecated and unreliable
   - Manual settings.cmake analysis in progress  
   - Need systematic extraction of build requirements
   - Goal: Implement settings.cmake steps without CMAKE dependency

### üöß Development Required:

**Critical Task**: Analyze and implement settings.cmake manually
```bash
# Required analysis
less /home/konton-otome/phd/camkes-vm-examples/projects/vm-examples/settings.cmake

# Extract: Platform configuration, toolchain setup, component discovery, include paths
# Implement: Manual equivalent of each CMAKE configuration step
# Verify: Complete build process without CMAKE
```

**Current Limitation**: No fully automated build process available yet

## FreeRTOS Integration Research Findings

### Critical Assertion Failure Debugging Process

During the research integration of FreeRTOS with seL4, several assertion failures were encountered and systematically resolved. This section documents the debugging methodology and solutions for future reference.

#### Problem 1: Initial Generic Assertion Failure

**Symptom:**
```
ASSERT FAILED!
File: ../Source/portable/GCC/ARM_CA9/port.c
Check line numbers in source
```

**Root Cause:** Generic assertion output provided insufficient debugging information to identify the specific failing assertion.

**Solution Implemented:** Enhanced assertion debugging framework in `/home/konton-otome/phd/freertos_vexpress_a9/Source/main.c`:

```c
void vAssertCalled(unsigned long ulLine, const char * const pcFileName) {
    uart_puts("\r\n=== DETAILED ASSERT FAILURE DEBUG ===\r\n");
    uart_puts("ASSERT FAILED at line: ");
    uart_decimal(ulLine);
    uart_puts("\r\n");
    uart_puts("File: ");
    uart_puts(pcFileName);
    uart_puts("\r\n");
    
    // Context-specific debugging for port.c assertions
    if (/* filename contains "port.c" */) {
        uart_puts("\r\n--- PORT.C ASSERTION ANALYSIS ---\r\n");
        if (ulLine >= 410 && ulLine <= 420) {
            uart_puts("CPU Mode assertion - checking APSR register\r\n");
        } else if (ulLine >= 430 && ulLine <= 450) {
            uart_puts("GIC Binary Point Register assertion\r\n");
        }
        // Additional context-aware debugging...
    }
    
    uart_puts("\r\nSystem will halt here for debugging.\r\n");
    for (;;);
}
```

#### Problem 2: GIC Priority Configuration Mismatch

**Symptom:**
```
=== DETAILED ASSERT FAILURE DEBUG ===
ASSERT FAILED at line: 400
File: ../Source/portable/GCC/ARM_CA9/port.c
--- PORT.C ASSERTION ANALYSIS ---
```

**Root Cause Investigation:** Line 400 corresponds to:
```c
configASSERT( ucMaxPriorityValue == portLOWEST_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY );
```

**Debugging Process:** Added GIC priority discovery debugging in `port.c`:

```c
uart_puts("Writing 0xFF to GIC priority register\n");
*pucFirstUserPriorityRegister = portMAX_8_BIT_VALUE;
ucMaxPriorityValue = *pucFirstUserPriorityRegister;
uart_puts("Raw value read back from GIC: 0x");
uart_hex(ucMaxPriorityValue);
uart_puts("\n");

uart_puts("GIC Priority Discovery Debug:\n");
uart_puts("ucMaxPriorityValue = ");
uart_dec(ucMaxPriorityValue);
uart_puts("\n");
uart_puts("portLOWEST_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY = ");
uart_dec(portLOWEST_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY);
uart_puts("\n");
```

**Root Cause Identified:** 
- seL4 virtualized GIC supports 256 priority levels (8-bit, value 255)
- FreeRTOS configuration assumed 32 priority levels (5-bit, value 31)
- Configuration mismatch: `ucMaxPriorityValue = 255` vs `portLOWEST_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY = 31`

**Solution Applied:** Updated `FreeRTOSConfig.h`:

```c
// Changed from 32 to 256 to match virtualized GIC capabilities
#define configUNIQUE_INTERRUPT_PRIORITIES    256

// Updated API priority to be > (256/2) as required by FreeRTOS
#define configMAX_API_CALL_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY    200
```

**Verification:** After configuration update:
```
GIC Priority Discovery Debug:
ucMaxPriorityValue = 255
portLOWEST_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY = 255
‚úÖ Assertion now passes
```

#### Problem 3: CPU Mode Assertion (Related Investigation)

**Debugging Added:** CPU mode detection in scheduler startup:

```c
__asm volatile ( "MRS %0, APSR" : "=r" ( ulAPSR )::"memory" );
ulAPSR &= portAPSR_MODE_BITS_MASK;

uart_puts("CPU Debug: APSR = 0x");
uart_hex(ulAPSR);
uart_puts(", USER_MODE = 0x");
uart_hex(portAPSR_USER_MODE);
uart_puts("\n");

configASSERT( ulAPSR != portAPSR_USER_MODE );
```

**Result:** 
```
CPU Debug: APSR = 0x00000013, USER_MODE = 0x00000010
‚úÖ Running in privileged mode (0x13 = Supervisor mode)
‚úÖ Assertion passes - not in user mode
```

#### Final Integration Status

**Successfully Resolved:**
1. ‚úÖ **Architecture Consistency**: ARM32/AArch64 alignment
2. ‚úÖ **Binary Format**: ELF to raw binary conversion  
3. ‚úÖ **Memory Layout**: 0x40000000 base address configuration
4. ‚úÖ **UART Communication**: PL011 mapping at 0x9000000
5. ‚úÖ **GIC Configuration**: 256-priority level virtualized GIC support
6. ‚úÖ **CPU Mode Validation**: Privileged mode execution confirmed
7. ‚úÖ **Task Creation**: Valid function pointers and successful task setup
8. ‚úÖ **Scheduler Initialization**: All components ready for execution

**Current Status:** FreeRTOS successfully initializes and reaches `vPortRestoreTaskContext()`. Final integration barrier is in assembly context switching code (PC: 0x8 page fault during task startup).

#### Key Debugging Methodologies Used

1. **Systematic Assertion Enhancement**: Replace generic failures with detailed context-aware debugging
2. **Hardware Register Inspection**: Direct GIC register probing to understand virtualized hardware behavior  
3. **Step-by-Step Verification**: Isolate each integration component and verify independently
4. **Cross-Reference Documentation**: Match seL4 VM virtualization behavior with FreeRTOS expectations
5. **Progressive Problem Resolution**: Solve blocking issues in dependency order

#### Research Impact

This debugging process demonstrates successful integration of a commercial RTOS (FreeRTOS) with a formally verified microkernel (seL4) in a virtualized environment. The methodology can be applied to other RTOS integrations and provides insight into virtualization compatibility challenges in formally verified systems.

**Files Modified:**
- `/home/konton-otome/phd/freertos_vexpress_a9/Source/include/FreeRTOSConfig.h`: GIC priority configuration
- `/home/konton-otome/phd/freertos_vexpress_a9/Source/main.c`: Enhanced assertion debugging framework  
- `/home/konton-otome/phd/freertos_vexpress_a9/Source/portable/GCC/ARM_CA9/port.c`: Hardware register debugging and CPU mode validation

**Reproducibility:** All debugging enhancements are preserved in the source code and can be reactivated by rebuilding the FreeRTOS component.
