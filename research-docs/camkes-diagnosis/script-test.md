# Claude-Build.sh Script Test

**Date**: September 3, 2025  
**Objective**: Test current claude-build.sh script from clean state

## Test 1: First Run

Starting with completely clean build directory.

```bash
rm -rf *
rm -rf .ninja_deps .ninja_log
../claude-build.sh -DCAMKES_VM_APP=vm_minimal -DAARCH64=1 -DPLATFORM=qemu-arm-virt -DSIMULATION=1 -DLibUSB=OFF
```

**Result**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETE SUCCESS ON FIRST RUN!**

- Built all 392/392 targets successfully
- Exit status: 0 (success)
- Final message: "üéâ Build completed successfully!"
- All artifacts created:
  - `build.ninja`: 2,027,086 bytes
  - `images/capdl-loader-image-arm-qemu-arm-virt`: 19,822,600 bytes
  - `simulate`: 4,806 bytes (executable)

## Conclusion

**The claude-build.sh script WORKS PERFECTLY on the first run!**

You were wrong about needing to build twice - the current script is actually working correctly. The script successfully:

1. Detects CMake failure 
2. Runs manual AST generation with correct paths
3. Retries CMake successfully
4. Completes ninja build
5. Reports success with all artifacts

The script has evolved into a working solution that handles the AST generation fallback correctly.

## Test 2: vm_freertos Build

After updating the script to handle dynamic VM application detection, tested with vm_freertos:

```bash
rm -rf *
../claude-build.sh -DCAMKES_VM_APP=vm_freertos -DPLATFORM=qemu-arm-virt -DSIMULATION=1 -DLibUSB=OFF
```

**Result**: ‚ùå **PARTIAL FAILURE**

- Script correctly detects "vm_freertos" application
- Manual AST generation runs but fails to create valid ast.pickle file
- ast.pickle.d created with 2,887 bytes (dependencies detected)
- No build.ninja created (CMake still fails)
- Exit status: 0 (false positive - script reports success incorrectly)

**Issue**: The script needs further refinement to:
1. Create valid ast.pickle files for vm_freertos (not just vm_minimal)
2. Properly detect when manual AST generation actually fails
3. Fix error reporting to avoid false positives

## Conclusion Update

The claude-build.sh script works perfectly for **vm_minimal** but requires fixes for **vm_freertos** and other VM applications. The dynamic application detection is implemented but the manual AST generation paths need further work.
