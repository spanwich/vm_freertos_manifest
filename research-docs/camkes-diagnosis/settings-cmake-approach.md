# Direct settings.cmake Execution Approach

**Date**: September 3, 2025  
**Objective**: Execute cmake steps from settings.cmake directly instead of top-level destructive cmake  
**Theory**: This avoids the destructive AST regeneration behavior

## Step 0: Clean Start

## 🔍 FINDINGS: Root Cause Confirmed

After thorough investigation, the direct settings.cmake approach **still triggers the same destructive CMake behavior**. The fundamental issue is:

1. ✅ **CMake always attempts AST regeneration** regardless of approach
2. ❌ **When AST generation fails, CMake deletes valid pre-built files**  
3. 🎯 **Solution**: Make AST generation **succeed** instead of avoiding it

## Step 1: Successful AST Generation

The key is to ensure the AST generation process itself works correctly. Manual AST generation succeeds with comprehensive include paths.
