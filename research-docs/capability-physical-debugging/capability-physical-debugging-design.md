# Capability-to-Physical Address Debugger Design

## Research Problem

**Gap**: seL4's capability system abstracts physical memory management, making it difficult to debug:
- Which physical addresses are controlled by which capabilities
- How capability operations affect physical memory layout
- Memory leaks and capability reference counting issues
- Physical memory fragmentation due to capability operations

## Your Research Contribution

### Core Innovation: **Capability-Physical Address Bridge**
Create debugging infrastructure that bridges the gap between:
1. **Capability Space**: Abstract capability references (CPtr, CNode, etc.)
2. **Physical Memory**: Real RAM addresses and mappings

## Technical Design

### New Debug Syscalls

```c
// Get physical addresses controlled by a capability
seL4_Word seL4_DebugCapabilityToPhysical(seL4_CPtr cap, 
                                         seL4_Word *phys_addrs, 
                                         seL4_Word max_addrs);

// Find capabilities that control a physical address
seL4_Word seL4_DebugPhysicalToCapability(seL4_Word phys_addr,
                                         seL4_CPtr *caps,
                                         seL4_Word max_caps);

// Get detailed memory mapping for capability
seL4_Error seL4_DebugCapabilityMemoryMap(seL4_CPtr cap,
                                         seL4_CapMemoryInfo_t *info);

// Trace capability operations on physical memory
seL4_Error seL4_DebugStartCapabilityTrace(seL4_Word trace_flags);
seL4_Word seL4_DebugGetCapabilityTrace(seL4_CapTraceEntry_t *entries,
                                       seL4_Word max_entries);
```

### Data Structures

```c
typedef struct {
    seL4_Word phys_addr;
    seL4_Word size;
    seL4_Word rights;          // Read/Write/Execute permissions
    seL4_Word ref_count;       // How many caps reference this memory
    seL4_CPtr controlling_cap; // Primary capability
} seL4_CapMemoryInfo_t;

typedef struct {
    seL4_Word timestamp;
    seL4_Word operation;       // Grant, Revoke, Delete, Map, Unmap
    seL4_CPtr capability;
    seL4_Word old_phys_addr;
    seL4_Word new_phys_addr;
    seL4_Word size;
} seL4_CapTraceEntry_t;
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Basic Capability-Physical Mapping
1. **Extend kernel data structures** to track capability-physical relationships
2. **Add reverse lookup tables** from physical addresses to capabilities
3. **Implement basic syscalls** for bidirectional lookup

### Phase 2: Advanced Debugging Features
1. **Memory access tracing** through capabilities
2. **Reference counting debugging** for capability-controlled memory
3. **Fragmentation analysis** of physical memory due to capability operations

### Phase 3: Integration with Existing Tools
1. **CAmkES integration** for component-level memory debugging
2. **capDL export** with physical address annotations
3. **GDB integration** for interactive capability-memory debugging

## Research Applications

### 1. Virtual Machine Memory Debugging
For your vm_freertos project:
- Debug guest physical memory allocation
- Track capability-controlled memory regions
- Identify memory leaks in virtualization layer
